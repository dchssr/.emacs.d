* Introduction

  If I had a nickel for every useless commit message that I used to do
  back in school, I could probably retire early on a yacht.
  But as I don't get paid for shoddy commit messages, I figured I
  ought to document my choices early and coherently.
  In other words, a literate configuration is the new direction.

  Before one can make a program from scratch, you must first
  ~git clone~ the universe.

  #+begin_src shell
    git clone git@github.com:dchesser/.emacs.d.git
  #+end_src

  To modify the source-code, use ~C-c '~ (control-C, then apostrophe)
  in the code blocks.
  Without further ado...

* Me

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (setq user-full-name "Dave Chesser"
             user-mail-address "dave@dchesser.website")
  #+end_src
  
  So the name's Dave. Hi.
  I'm a programmer by trade, so [[https://gnu.org/s/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] was a logical choice in tooling.

  - It's been around for decades, so it's no passing fad.
  - It's popular, so there's almost a package for /everything/.
  - It's scripted via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/][Emacs Lisp]], its dialect of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], to serve as
    its own computing environment as well as a method of extending
    its capabilities.

* Customizations

  ~M-x customize-group <RET> D <RET>~ for more details.

** Fonts

*** ~D-preferred-fonts-list~

    List of font names to prefer when opening a frame.
    If none of the fonts are available, the default
    will be "Monospace".

*** ~D-preferred-font-size~

    The chosen font size for the font chosen in
    ~D-preferred-fonts-list~.

* Preparation

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (unbind-key "C-z")
  #+end_src

* Packages
** Magit

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package magit
      :bind ("<f12>" . magit-status))
  #+end_src

  [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is an interactive Git front-end to [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]].
  No more memorizing all the different command flags just to manage my
  code commitments; slap a few keys and you're good to go.

  To pull up the Git status for a buffer, press ~F12~.

** AUCTeX

   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex][AUCTeX]] is a package for helping with TeX documents.
   Ensuring this package isn't straight-forward as it doesn't ~provide~
   an ~auctex~ feature, but ~tex~ instead.

   #+begin_quote
   The reason ~(use-package tex :ensure t)~ doesn't work for ~auctex~
   is because ~auctex~ names a GNU ELPA package (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html][~(emacs) Packages~]]),
   whereas ~tex~ names a feature (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Named-Features.html][~(elisp) Named Features~]]) provided
   by the ~auctex~ package.

   #+end_quote

   The following snippet can also be found on the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/#package-installation][~use-package~]] README:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package tex
       :ensure auctex
       :custom
       (ConTeXt-Mark-version "IV" "AUCTeX looks like it's still on MkII."))
   #+end_src

** Markdown

   [[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] ([[https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][major mode]]) is a text format meant to be converted to rich text.
   It's used in countless places on-line.
   Markdown is /especially/ the main way I write posts on [[https://dchesser.website][my Web site]].
   Think of it as a super-set rather than a sub-set of regular markup.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package markdown-mode)
   #+end_src

** Modus Themes

   The [[https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes/#][Modus themes]] are a couple of themes aimed to have decent contrast.
   That they have decent theme and mode coverage is another plus.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package modus-themes
       :config
       (modus-themes-load-operandi))
   #+end_src

   I use Modus Operandi (the light theme) because dark themes are /awful/
   on low-resolution displays.
   Even in this day and age, 1600 pixels by 900 pixels is a luxury to me.
   White-on-black text anti-aliasing is terrible, making it more like
   grey-on-black text.
   That and I'm also 95% of the time in good lighting where I'm not
   screeching and clawing at my eye-holes while burning in the glare.

** Lua Mode

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package lua-mode
       :custom
       (lua-indent-level 4))
   #+end_src

** Emmet

  [[https://emmet.io/][Emmet]] is a faster way to write markup.
  Life doesn't revolve around Markdown as much as folk like
  and writing markup is hella painful on the wrists.
  Punching in CSS-selector-styled renders up what I intended
  in fewer keystrokes than it took to write this paragraph.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package emmet-mode
      :hook
      ((mhtml-mode . emmet-mode)
       (css-mode   . emmet-mode)))
  #+end_src
